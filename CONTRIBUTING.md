Contribute
==========

The latest stable version is always in the **[master](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone)** branch (which always
points at the latest version tag).

The latest development version is in the **[develop](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/tree/develop)** branch.

> Use the develop branch if you want to contribute or test features.

Please do also **send pull requests to the `develop` branch**.
I will **not** merge pull requests to the `master` branch.


> Please provide a test for any new feature


Communicate
-----------

Before you start implementing new features, please create an issue about it first and discuss your intent.
It might be something that someone else is already implementing or that goes against the concepts of Dropzone, and I really hate rejecting pull requests others spent hours writing on.


Coffeescript
------------

Dropzone is written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org)
so *do not* make changes to the Javascript files.

**I will not merge requests written in Javascript.**

Please don't include compiled `.js` files in your pull requests but only
`.coffee` files. That way pull requests aren't polluted and I can see
immediately what you changed.


* Thanks for contributing!*
